// passPort(is a middleware) use FOR authentication this is   this is a third party middleware

// Authentication middleware is a pasport 
// many of the prebuild statergy are there 


// Install Passport

// To use Passport.js in a Node.js application, you need to install the passport package along with the authentication strategies you intend to use.

// For this course, we are using Local strategies authentication (username and password).

// You would typically install passport-local

// npm install passport passport-local


// Once you’ve installed these packages, you can set up and configure Passport.js in your application.

// const express = require('express');
// const passport = require('passport');
// const LocalStrategy = require('passport-local').Strategy;

// const app = express();

// // Initialize Passport
// app.use(passport.initialize());
